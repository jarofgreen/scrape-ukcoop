description: "Thank you to all the co-ops who took part in our consultation to inform\
  \ the\_Scottish government review of how to increase the number of co-ops, social\
  \ enterprises and employee-owned businesses. We are optimistic that the final report\
  \ will reflect the needs and aspirations of our members.\_However, the outputs of\
  \ the review will only be recommendations. Given the collapse of the coalition,\
  \ there is now a large question mark over the future direction of Scottish government.\_\
  A collective effort from the co-operative movement is essential to convince the\
  \ minority SNP government to adopt and enact these policies and continue with the\
  \ wellbeing economy agenda.\_While we await the final publication of the review,\
  \ we want to meet with Scottish co-operatives to consider next steps. At this online\
  \ meeting, we'll be discussing:The future of the co-operative and democratic business\
  \ agenda in ScotlandHow co-operatives can seize potential new opportunities in ScotlandHow\
  \ co-operatives can best position themselves as strategic partners to Scottish government\
  \ in delivering the review recommendationsHow Co-operatives UK can best support\
  \ Scottish members\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n                  Book now"
